  <h1>In traditional Chinese physiognomy, the shape of your lips represents your personality and desires. It can even tell if a person likes to lie. </h1>
  <h2 class="center"><br>
    Bow-shaped lips have a distinct personality and are clear about their goals.<br>Downward-turned lips are sensitive and relatively reserved, with a strong sense of empathy.
  </h2>
  <p class="center"><br>
    People with full lips are natural and attractive, with good connections.<br>
  People with heart shaped lips are curious and lively, like to have fun and have the potential to be leaders.</p>
